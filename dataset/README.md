## Subsets

Pre-defined task subsets are available in `subsets/` for quick evaluation:

| Subset | Tasks | Pairs | Repos | Description |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| `nano` | 20 | 20 | 9 | Single-language (Python) coordination benchmark; one gold-conflict pair per task |
| `flash` | 20 | 50 | 11 | Dev subset for rapid iteration (sampled from lite) |
| `lite` | 26 | 100 | 12 | Quick evaluation subset |

The `nano` subset is a Python-only instrument for measuring whether a multi-agent communication protocol improves conflict resolution. It holds 20 gold merge-conflict pairs, one per task across 9 Python repos, selected offline by static feature-overlap (a proxy for conflict severity). Single-language by design — it removes the language×repo confound and lets pairs (independent clusters) scale for statistical power. Run each pair many times (`--repeats`) per condition; validity is confirmed post-hoc from the no-messaging control. See `docs/nano_py_preregistration.md`.

Both subsets are generated via **uniform pair-level sampling**:

```python
random.seed(42)  # fixed seed for reproducibility

# Generate all possible feature pairs from dataset
all_pairs = []
for task in all_tasks:
    for f1, f2 in combinations(task.features, 2):
        all_pairs.append((task.repo, task.task_id, [f1, f2]))

# Sample 100 pairs uniformly
sampled_pairs = random.sample(all_pairs, 100)
# Result: 23 tasks, 100 pairs, 11 repos
```

Each task in the subset includes a `pairs` field specifying exactly which feature pairs are included:

```json
{
  "repo": "pallets_jinja_task",
  "task_id": 1621,
  "pairs": [[1, 6], [2, 9], [3, 4], ...]
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
cooperbench run --subset lite --setting coop
```

## Usage

Each task represents a pull request that was split into multiple independent features. Agents are assigned features to implement, and their outputs are evaluated for correctness and merge compatibility.

See the main CooperBench documentation for details on running experiments.
