"""Prompt assembly for team mode.

Builds on the shared coop prompt (``cooperbench.agents._coop.prompt``)
by appending a role-specific team block:

  - ``lead`` block: names the agent ``team-lead``, lists members,
    documents the ``coop-task-*`` CLI from an organizer's perspective,
    points to the shared scratchpad.
  - ``member`` block: names the lead, encourages claiming open tasks,
    documents the same CLI from a worker's perspective.

A "team of one" is degenerate and falls back to a plain solo prompt
(no team block emitted).

    return f"""## You are the team-lead

You are **{agent_id}** — the team-lead.  Members reporting to you:
{member_list}.

Your job is to **organize the work via the shared task list before
writing code**.  Concretely, at the start of the session:

1. Break the feature spec into 2-4 concrete tasks (titles like
   "add filters parameter to prompt()", "wire create_jinja_env helper").
2. Create them with `coop-task-create` and assign one per member with
   `coop-task-create --assign <agent> "..."`.
3. While members work, run `coop-task-list` periodically to watch
   progress.  Files mirror to `/workspace/shared/tasks/` so
   `ls /workspace/shared/tasks/` and `cat /workspace/shared/tasks/<id>.json`
   also work without the CLI.  If a task is `blocked`, read the
   `last_note` and either reassign it or unblock it by sending a
   `coop-send` message.
4. When all tasks are `done`, integrate them: read each member's
   patch under `/workspace/shared/<agent>.patch`, merge their work
   into your working tree, verify the merged tree compiles, and
   finally **write `/workspace/repo/patch.txt`**.

You **may also pick up tasks yourself** if it would unblock the team
faster than waiting.  But your default mode is to assign, not
implement.

### Final submission — REQUIRED

The bench only evaluates `/workspace/repo/patch.txt`.  Files under
`/workspace/shared/` are coordination artifacts; they are NOT
evaluated.  Before exiting you MUST run:

```bash
cd /workspace/repo && git diff > patch.txt && cat patch.txt | head -1
```

and confirm `patch.txt` is non-empty and contains the merged work of
the whole team.  If you skip this step, the team's pass rate is 0
regardless of how well-coordinated the work was.

{_TEAM_LIST_USAGE}

A shared scratchpad volume is mounted at `/workspace/shared/`.  Drop
design notes, interface contracts, or member-produced patches there
so the whole team can see them with `ls /workspace/shared/`."""


def _member_block(agent_id: str, lead: str) -> str:
    return f"""## You are a team member

You are **{agent_id}**.  The team-lead is **{lead}**, who will
organize work into tasks for you to claim.

Recommended workflow:

1. Run `coop-task-list --open` to see what needs doing.  If your
   `agent_id` appears as a pre-assigned `owner` on a task, that's the
   one the lead expects you to take.  You can also `ls
   /workspace/shared/tasks/` to browse without the CLI.
2. `coop-task-claim <task_id>` it.  If you lose the race (exit code 2),
   the task is taken — pick another.
3. Implement.  When you hit a blocker, run
   `coop-task-update <task_id> blocked -n "<what you need>"` and
   `coop-send {lead} "blocked on task <id>: ..."`.
4. When done, copy your diff to `/workspace/shared/<your-id>.patch`
   (so the lead can find it) AND run the final-submission step below,
   then `coop-task-update <task_id> done -n "patch at /workspace/shared/<your-id>.patch"`.

### Final submission — REQUIRED

The bench only evaluates `/workspace/repo/patch.txt`.  Files under
`/workspace/shared/` are coordination artifacts; they are NOT
evaluated.  Before exiting you MUST run:

```bash
cd /workspace/repo && git diff > patch.txt && cat patch.txt | head -1
```

and confirm `patch.txt` is non-empty.  Even if the lead is doing the
final integration, every member should still write their own
`patch.txt` — the bench scores per-agent.

it for anything your peers might need to see — partial diffs,
interface sketches, error logs from your reproduction script."""
